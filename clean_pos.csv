For altered mental status and fevers, repeat head CT showed no change in bleed. Prednisone and levetiractam were continued. LP showed blood and possible infection. He remained febrile. His antibiotics (vanc/ceftriaxone) were increased to meningitis dose ceftriaxone, and acyclovir was added for HSV coverage pending PCR. TSH was normal. Mental status improved gradually. He was called out to the medicine floor. . On the medical floor, mental status remained stable, extremely drowsy and difficult to arouse.

At the time of departure from cc7, his O2 Sat was mid-90s on 2L NC. Upon return from CT, O2 was 83% on 2L. 6L was required to bring O2 Sat to 91%. CXR showed new LLL and partial LUL collapse. ABG was 7.50/30/44. Mental status at that time was notable for alert and tracking, nonverbal. Shortly thereafter, O2 Sat fell, and nonrebreather was applied. Despite this, O2 Sat fell into the 70s.
